## What spotDL does

1. Downloads music from YouTube as an MP3 file
2. Applies basic metadata gathered from Spotify such as:
    - Track Name
    - Track Number
    - Album
    - Album Cover
    - Genre
    - and more!

### Redesigned

spotDL is being redesigned! This means we are currently not accepting new feature requests. You can talk to us on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/xCa23pwJWY) if there is anything further.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.6.1 or above (added to PATH)
-   FFmpeg 4.2 or above (added to PATH)

> **_YouTube Music must be available in your country for spotDL to work. This is because we use YouTube Music to filter search results. You can check if YouTube Music is available in your country, by visiting [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com)._**

## Installation

### Installing FFmpeg

-   [Windows Tutorial](https://windowsloop.com/install-ffmpeg-windows-10/)
-   OSX - `brew install ffmpeg`
-   Linux - `sudo apt install ffmpeg`

### Installing spotDL

```

#### Arch

There is an Arch User Repository (AUR) package for [spotDL](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-spotdl/).

## Usage

-   #### To download a song, run

    ```bash
    spotdl [trackUrl]
    ```

    ```

-   #### To download an album, run

    ```bash
    spotdl [albumUrl]
    ```

    example:

    spotdl https://open.spotify.com/album/4yP0hdKOZPNshxUOjY0cZj
    ```

-   #### To download a playlist, run

    ```bash
    spotdl [playlistUrl]
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    spotdl https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E8UXBoz02kGID
    ```

-   #### To download all songs from an artist run

    spotdl [artistUrl]
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    spotdl https://open.spotify.com/artist/1fZAAHNWdSM5gqbi9o5iEA
    ```

-   #### To search for and download a song, run, **with quotation marks**

    spotdl '[songQuery]'
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    spotdl 'The Weeknd - Blinding Lights'
    ```

    > _Note: This is not accurate and often causes errors._

    spotdl [pathToTrackingFile]
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    spotdl 'The Weeknd - Blinding Lights.spotdlTrackingFile'

    > _Note: `.spotdlTrackingFile`s are automatically created when a download starts and deleted on completion_

-   #### You can queue up multiple download tasks by separating the arguments with spaces

    ```bash
    spotdl [songQuery1] [albumUrl] [songQuery2] ... (order does not matter)
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    spotdl 'The Weeknd - Blinding Lights' https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E8UXBoz02kGID ...
    ```

    > _Note: spotDL downloads up to 4 songs in parallel, so for a faster experience, download albums and playlist, rather than tracks._

-   #### To download youtube video with metadata from spotify run:

    ```bash
    spotdl "YouTubeURL|SpotifyURL"
    ```

    example:

    > Note: Urls have to be separated with `|` and quoted properly ex. "YouTubeURL|SpotifyUrl"

    ```

    ```

## `pipx` Isolated Environment Alternative

For users who are not familiar with `pipx`, it can be used to run scripts **without**
installing the spotDL package and all the dependencies globally with pip. (Effectively
skipping over the [spotDL Installation](#Installing-spotDL) step)

First, you will need to install `pipx` by running:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

Next, you can jump directly to running spotDL with:

```bash
pipx run spotdl ...
```
